tomcast
=======
tomcast reads mpeg transport streams over http or udp (multicast or
unicast) and outputs them to chosen multicast group. Basically a simple
http2multicast daemon designed to work 24/7.

License
=======
tsdecrypt is released under GNU GPL v2.

Development
===========
The development is done using git. tomcast repository is hosted
at http://github.com/gfto/tomcast

To clone the repository issue the following commands:

   git clone git://github.com/gfto/tomcast.git
   cd tomcast
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   make

The code is developed and tested under modern Linux. It is also
compiled from time to time under OS X but is not tested there.

To see all Makefile targets run 'make help'.

Updating the code
=================
To update cloned tomcast, go to the directory where the repository
is cloned and run the following commands:

   git fetch origin
   git merge origin/master
   git submodule update
   make clean all

tomcast's master branch should always be useful so it is safe to
use it instead of official release. The master branch will always
be better than any released version.
